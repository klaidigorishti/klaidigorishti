# Hi! 👋 I am Klaidi 💻

I am a software engineer focused on backend technologies, highly proficient in JavaScript (ES6) and TypeScript. Frontend development is a direction I am currently investing on improving myself to broaden my skillset and expertise, with frameworks such as React.

First and foremost, I love to dig into customer problems and solve them with innovative approaches. It brings such a genuine joy to my heart to explore new perspectives on challenges and develop solutions. For me programming is like magic, it can improve people's lives and change the way how we interact with the world. This is what motivates and drives my passion for programming in particular, and computer science in general.

My professional journey has enabled me to explore various software engineering aspects, while working with several small & big projects. Among those I can highlight the development of iOS applications with Swift, machine learning solutions with Python and TensorFlow, and some Java projects. Throughout my personal and professional experience, I have learned the following about myself:

- I put the customer at the center of all that I do
- I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints
- I have a strong sense and awareness for algorithms' performance and scalability

I can align, coordinate, and collaborate with project teams.
- I love to win, but supporting the team win gives me greater joy
- I am able to break down complex tech topics and communicate them clearly with peers

I educate, refine, and drive myself to be a better person.
- I am constantly learning because I never settle
