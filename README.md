# Hi! 👋 I'm Klaidi 💻

> 👨🏻‍💻 Software Engineer | 📡 Tech Enthusiast | 👨🏻‍🎓 TUM Alumni | 🚀 Stock Trader | 🎮 Gamer | 🌱 Bonsai Lover | 💭 Amat Victoria Curam

I am a software engineer focused on back end technologies, highly proficient in Javascript (ES6) and Typescript. Front end development is a direction that I am currently investing on improving myself to broaden my skillset and expertise, with frameworks such as React. On my daily work as a software engineer, I have a strong sense and awareness for algorithms' performance and scalability in the digital solutions I implement.

For me programming is like magic, it can improve people lives and change the way how we interact with the world. This is what motivates and drives my passion for programming in particular and computer science in general. My journey in the world of computer science started during my graduate studies, period when I worked with several small & big projects. Among those I can highlight the development of iOS applications with Swift, machine learning solutions with Python and Tensorflow, and a couple of Java projects.

What characterizes me, is the openness and eagerness to continuously learn and expand my knowledge. Even though I am a software engineer mainly developing back end services, my current professional journey has allowed me to jump into different roles such as: the development of web analytics with Scala, and even leading small software projects in the position of a product owner. Exploring such experiences which the world of software engineering has to offer is always fun and has helped me to build a broader and solid professional background.

I am always excited and looking forward into meeting new people, exchanging experiences and learning!

Feel free to get in touch :)
